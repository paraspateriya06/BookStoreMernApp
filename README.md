# 📚 Book Store MERN App

An interactive, full-stack Book Store web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It lets users browse, add, update, and delete books — demonstrating my ability to build a CRUD-based product from scratch with scalable architecture.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Implemented modular **MVC structure** in Express for scalable backend
- Applied **React state management** and conditional rendering for dynamic UX
- Used **Axios** for frontend-backend communication with async error handling
- Deployed REST APIs with consistent naming conventions and error responses
- Practiced **full-cycle development**: backend → frontend → integration → debugging
